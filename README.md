This neovim config is a fork of https://github.com/jdhao/nvim-config. I forked this one as I wanted something with UltiSnips, nvim-lspconfig, and TreeSitter configuration as well as sane defaults. Native LSP and TreeSitter support was the main reason why I went with neovim.

Most of what I use nvim for right now is taking notes. I use markdown which gets transpiled to latex and then typeset with pdflatex. I take notes in real time during lecture, so the speed of the setup is vital.

Notable differences from the original configuration: I removed several unneeded plugins and functionality already provided to me by tmux, and added a few tweaks of my own.

I am heavily inspired by this article: https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/.
